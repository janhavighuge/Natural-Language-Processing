# Spam Classifier

## Introduction
This project aims to build a spam classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The dataset used for this project contains labeled messages, indicating whether they are spam or not.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook file named `SpamClassifier.ipynb`. The notebook contains the Python code and analysis performed on the spam classification task. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to load and preprocess the data, create a Bag of Words model, train the Naive Bayes classifier, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Spam Classifier project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python (version 3.6 or higher) and Jupyter Notebook on your system.

2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

3. Open the `SpamClassifier.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells and perform the spam classification analysis.

## Usage
The `SpamClassifier.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive guide on how to build a spam classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Each code cell is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose and functionality. You can execute the cells one by one to see the results.

The notebook covers various aspects of the spam classification task, including:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Creating a Bag of Words model
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training the Naive Bayes classifier
- Making predictions on the test data
- Evaluating the model's performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score


## Resources
The project utilizes the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which is publicly available. The dataset can be accessed from the following source:

Please refer to the source for any additional information about the dataset.

## Conclusion
The Spam Classifier project provides a starting point for building a spam classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. By following the instructions in the notebook, you can preprocess the data, create a Bag of Words model, train the classifier, and evaluate its performance.
